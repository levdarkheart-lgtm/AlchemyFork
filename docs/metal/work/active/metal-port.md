# Active execution plan — full native Alchemy Metal conversion

**Owner:** Codex integrator. **Outcome:** complete `docs/metal/PRODUCT.md`, not a
demo. **Evidence contract:** `docs/metal/VALIDATION.md` and
`docs/metal/PERFORMANCE.md`. **History:** [archive index](../archive/INDEX.md).
**Renderer checkpoint:** Commit `e55ea15076`.

This ledger contains current decisions and executable work only. Completed
checkpoint detail belongs in the indexed archive.

## Work board

| ID | Work | State | Evidence / next boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-001 | Reproducible ARM64 OSS build and reference baseline | doing | Source-exact ARM64 build/package identity passes; controlled performance baseline remains open. |
| M-002 | GL/shader/pass/resource and binary inventory | doing | 2,408 files and 3,262 findings; strict exits 1. The one-finding increase is a preprocessor-unaware split of the final blit, while Darwin post-AA/sharpen symbols are absent from the binary. |
| M-003 | Native drawable, presentation and lifecycle | doing | Exact Metal publication exists; SSR warm-up is explicitly barred from presentation. |
| M-004 | Metal resources, transfers, readback and synchronization | doing | Core paths are physical-GPU covered; direct owned reads, RGBA/typed uploads and production native mip generation are native-only. |
| M-005 | MSL and explicit pipeline/resource binding | doing | Production library and established variants load; add only source/evidence-driven variants. |
| M-006 | UI, fonts, HUD and media ingress | doing | Darwin media resources and grayscale/color font-atlas pages are native-only; owner-attended text/emoji and moving-media parity remain open. |
| M-007 | World scene and material correctness | doing | Opaque fullbright is corrected; legacy BLEND/stained glass and broad material parity remain open. |
| M-008 | Advanced views/effects and compute | doing | Established debug/advanced owners, color grading, tone curve, BRDF, post FXAA/SMAA/CAS, DoF and world HDR bloom/cross-filter are native-only; native-eligible PBR previews own geometry/post/publish. |
| M-009 | Feature parity, stability and native-only cleanup | doing | Full matrix, stability, strict no-GL, linked/runtime no-GL and visual review remain open. |
| M-010 | M1 Max profiling and optimization | deferred | Qualifying paired quality-equivalent measurements follow stable parity. |
| M-011 | Remove duplicate GL authority owner by owner | doing | Eligible PBR previews now skip their GL setup/draw/post transaction, but the generic scheduler still acquires/binds/clears a shared GL target before attempting them. Unsupported fallback remains. |
| M-012 | Development Computer Use / LLUI accessibility | complete | Semantic operation is verified; comparison driving is reserved for the owner-attended daily window. |
| M-013 | RLVa strict parity | deferred | Owner-designated non-release nice-to-have; minimum no-GL behavior remains required. |

States describe evidence, not effort. `complete` applies only to a bounded work
item and never implies product completion.

## Active checkpoint — native preview CPU matrices and fallback GL state

Commit `e55ea15076` builds the eligible Darwin preview modelview/projection on
the CPU and moves its base GL pre-render, clear/masks/depth/stencil/scissor,
retained matrix load, auxiliary target pack and post scope into the fallback.
The successful preview retains earlier shader/geometry/light/probe/post/publish
cuts. The generic scheduler still unbinds GL and acquires/binds/clears the
shared Preview target before invoking it, then flushes and restores the GL
viewport. Classic/non-HDR/post-suppressed/incomplete/failed-native cases and
non-Darwin behavior remain unchanged. No viewer was launched or compared; row
17 advanced to build 68173.

## Validation checkpoint

- Source-exact warnings-as-errors Release build `26.4.0d68173` passed at
  `e55ea15076c88caab5c409b7becc9de7fa7f8770`; the RelWithDebInfo appearance
  utility also builds at that source.
- The full native Metal binary passes 52,381 assertions across 55 cases with
  API and shader validation enabled. Focused complete PBR material-preview
  coverage passes 201 assertions.
- The full `alrender_tests` suite passes 557,312 assertions across 137 cases;
  its focused resource-plan matrix passes 3,376 assertions across 37 cases.
- Physical fresh-context renderer validation passes 2,243 assertions across 94
  cases. CPU-only renderer validation passes 1,513 assertions across 203 cases;
  202 pass and one established font-palette case skips.
- The full `newview_tests` binary passes 98,973 assertions across 743 cases;
  one platform CRT case skips as expected.
- `tools/metal/verify_app.sh` reports 349/349 ARM64 Mach-O slices.
- Viewer executable SHA-256:
  `8c0fa87660d9f8e4209f3f3ff3615316108bb0668aff639dcc6a9b3705e4524e`.
  Appearance utility:
  `c3e87e6a8f87c09c44e61aee502f6afd22e5f4bd1b82dd8c952c2fa05fba89a5`.
  Source/packaged MSL:
  `fa6821703a980b570305fc2384fcb11a1980fccad43d35e4626e40cc4b323324`.
  Metallib:
  `ebd7034235c4f35b13c9874029eff6bbcb61cc3f56c7f3907fd581c112eb96ab`.
- The broad retained-GL suite remains at 8,335/8,340 assertions and 181/224
  cases, with its four established failures and 39 skips.
- Strict inventory is 2,408 files / 3,262 findings, expected exit 1. Exact
  report SHA-256:
  `18eb1ab8a12306e3263672506bf5a3ced248b89e298245a2edc5d67eb46e1c15`.
  Both OpenGL and Metal remain linked.
- Static symbol inspection finds none of the retained FXAA/SMAA/CAS/sharpen or
  DoF program globals or retained DoF methods in the exact Darwin objects.
  The retained bloom programs and generator remain present because unsupported
  preview configurations still reference them; eligible native previews bypass
  that transaction.
- No viewer executable was launched, driven or compared for this checkpoint.

## Owner-attended visual review cadence

Do not autonomously launch either viewer, navigate login/world UI or capture a
comparison. Add a bounded question and prerequisites to the
[daily visual review queue](visual-review-queue.md). At most once per day, the
owner and Codex may work through ready rows together. Existing artifacts may be
summarized, but no row closes without explicit owner-attended evidence.

## Complete-product checkpoint gate

1. **Product advancement:** yes—a complete native PBR preview owns CPU-derived
   camera matrices plus shader geometry, light state, post and publication;
   its preview-specific GL setup/draw/post transaction is fallback-only.
2. **Deferred critical work:** remaining GL context/traversal/resources;
   feature/stability matrices; visual queue; strict binary/runtime audit;
   measured M1 Max performance; independent review and release proof.
3. **Priority reassessment:** add a native-first scheduler path that takes the
   shared Preview GL target only for same-frame fallback, then widen eligibility.

Checkpoint count, elapsed time, commit volume and test volume are supporting
signals only; none substitutes for movement toward a release criterion.

## Immediate executable action

Add a fail-closed native-first dynamic-texture contract before
`ALOnDemandTarget` acquisition/bind/clear. On a failed or unsupported attempt,
take the shared Preview GL target and execute the existing retained callback in
the same frame, without changing other UI preview or bake ordering. Then extend
exact ownership to classic/non-HDR/post-suppressed variants.

## Non-negotiable open gates

- Do not globally suppress GL traversal before each retained side effect has a
  native owner or an explicit removal proof.
- Do not mark feature parity from build/test success alone. An unreviewed queue
  row is not evidence.
- Do not claim performance improvement without paired, provenance-complete,
  quality-equivalent M1 Max measurements meeting `docs/metal/PERFORMANCE.md`.
- Do not weaken fail-closed native authority, snapshot, appearance-readback or
  presentation gates.
