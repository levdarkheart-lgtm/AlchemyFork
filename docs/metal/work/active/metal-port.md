## Work board

| ID | Work | State | Evidence / next boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M-001 | Reproducible ARM64 OSS build and reference baseline | doing | Source-exact ARM64 build/package identity passes; controlled performance baseline remains open. |
| M-002 | GL/shader/pass/resource and binary inventory | doing | 2,408 files and 3,262 findings; strict exits 1. The one-finding increase is a preprocessor-unaware split of the final blit, while Darwin post-AA/sharpen symbols are absent from the binary. |
| M-003 | Native drawable, presentation and lifecycle | doing | Exact Metal publication exists; SSR warm-up is explicitly barred from presentation. |
| M-004 | Metal resources, transfers, readback and synchronization | doing | Core paths are physical-GPU covered; direct owned reads, RGBA/typed uploads and production native mip generation are native-only. |
| M-005 | MSL and explicit pipeline/resource binding | doing | Production library and established variants load; add only source/evidence-driven variants. |
| M-006 | UI, fonts, HUD and media ingress | doing | Darwin media resources and grayscale/color font-atlas pages are native-only; owner-attended text/emoji and moving-media parity remain open. |
| M-007 | World scene and material correctness | doing | Opaque fullbright is corrected; legacy BLEND/stained glass and broad material parity remain open. |
| M-008 | Advanced views/effects and compute | doing | Established debug/advanced owners, color grading, tone curve, BRDF, post FXAA/SMAA/CAS, DoF and world HDR bloom/cross-filter are native-only; native-eligible PBR previews own geometry/post/publish. |
| M-009 | Feature parity, stability and native-only cleanup | doing | Full matrix, stability, strict no-GL, linked/runtime no-GL and visual review remain open. |
| M-010 | M1 Max profiling and optimization | deferred | Qualifying paired quality-equivalent measurements follow stable parity. |
| M-011 | Remove duplicate GL authority owner by owner | doing | The established resources plus pipeline BRDF, post-AA/CAS, DoF and world bloom own no GL path; eligible PBR previews skip GL shader/geometry/light/probe/post/publish, while unsupported fallback and shared viewport/matrix/clear setup remain. |
| M-012 | Development Computer Use / LLUI accessibility | complete | Semantic operation is verified; comparison driving is reserved for the owner-attended daily window. |
| M-013 | RLVa strict parity | deferred | Owner-designated non-release nice-to-have; minimum no-GL behavior remains required. |

States describe evidence, not effort. `complete` applies only to a bounded work
item and never implies product completion.

## Active checkpoint — native-eligible material-preview retained-light state

Commit `88f1677884` confines retained preview light/probe state to the fallback.
An eligible native PBR preview now skips the GL shader/geometry/post/publication
transaction plus local-light setting changes, retained default-probe uniform
updates, hardware-light setup and GL light-zero mutation. The callback performs
and restores those changes only for classic/non-HDR/post-suppressed, incomplete
or failed-native configurations. Shared GL pre-render, viewport/matrix/clear
state remains. Non-Darwin behavior is unchanged. No viewer was launched or
compared; the one material-preview queue row advanced to build 68171.

## Validation checkpoint

- Source-exact warnings-as-errors Release build `26.4.0d68171` passed at
  `88f1677884181e0b8b3524175dab76c545cb2183`; the RelWithDebInfo appearance
  utility also builds at that source.
- The full native Metal binary passes 52,381 assertions across 55 cases with
  API and shader validation enabled. Focused complete PBR material-preview
  coverage passes 201 assertions.
- The full `alrender_tests` suite passes 557,312 assertions across 137 cases;
  its focused resource-plan matrix passes 3,376 assertions across 37 cases.
- Physical fresh-context renderer validation passes 2,243 assertions across 94
  cases. CPU-only renderer validation passes 1,513 assertions across 203 cases;
  202 pass and one established font-palette case skips.
- The full `newview_tests` binary passes 98,973 assertions across 743 cases;
  one platform CRT case skips as expected.
- `tools/metal/verify_app.sh` reports 349/349 ARM64 Mach-O slices.
- Viewer executable SHA-256:
  `fd10040bf4fc8c110f9cbbfc8b45d8f569256da5ba8f3c126baa9ddf8435ab5c`.
  Appearance utility:
  `c3e87e6a8f87c09c44e61aee502f6afd22e5f4bd1b82dd8c952c2fa05fba89a5`.
  Source/packaged MSL:
  `fa6821703a980b570305fc2384fcb11a1980fccad43d35e4626e40cc4b323324`.
  Metallib:
  `ebd7034235c4f35b13c9874029eff6bbcb61cc3f56c7f3907fd581c112eb96ab`.
- The broad retained-GL suite remains at 8,335/8,340 assertions and 181/224
  cases, with its four established failures and 39 skips.
- Strict inventory is 2,408 files / 3,262 findings, expected exit 1. Exact
  report SHA-256:
  `589b98fbc15cee351f34a264f75341e80b762d9bdd071958f469bdfc67967019`.
  Both OpenGL and Metal remain linked.
- Static symbol inspection finds none of the retained FXAA/SMAA/CAS/sharpen or
  DoF program globals or retained DoF methods in the exact Darwin objects.
  The retained bloom programs and generator remain present because unsupported
  preview configurations still reference them; eligible native previews bypass
  that transaction.
- No viewer executable was launched, driven or compared for this checkpoint.

## Owner-attended visual review cadence

Do not autonomously launch either viewer, navigate login/world UI or capture a
comparison. Add a bounded question and prerequisites to the
[daily visual review queue](visual-review-queue.md). At most once per day, the
owner and Codex may work through ready rows together. Existing artifacts may be
summarized, but no row closes without explicit owner-attended evidence.

## Complete-product checkpoint gate

1. **Product advancement:** yes—a complete native PBR preview owns shader
   geometry, direct/default-probe light state, post and publication without
   redundant retained GL draw/light/probe/post work or framebuffer copy.
2. **Deferred critical work:** remaining GL context/traversal/resources;
   feature/stability matrices; visual queue; strict binary/runtime audit;
   measured M1 Max performance; independent review and release proof.
3. **Priority reassessment:** derive native preview camera/matrices on the CPU,
   defer GL pre-render/clear/state into fallback, then widen exact eligibility.

Checkpoint count, elapsed time, commit volume and test volume are supporting
signals only; none substitutes for movement toward a release criterion.

## Immediate executable action

Derive the native preview camera/modelview/projection snapshot directly on the
CPU and defer dynamic-texture GL pre-render, clear/mask/state setup and matrix
loads into the retained callback. Then extend exact native ownership to
classic/non-HDR/post-suppressed variants and retire preview-only GL resources
only when unreachable.

## Non-negotiable open gates

- Do not globally suppress GL traversal before each retained side effect has a
  native owner or an explicit removal proof.
- Do not mark feature parity from build/test success alone. An unreviewed queue
  row is not evidence.
- Do not claim performance improvement without paired, provenance-complete,
  quality-equivalent M1 Max measurements meeting `docs/metal/PERFORMANCE.md`.
- Do not weaken fail-closed native authority, snapshot, appearance-readback or
  presentation gates.
